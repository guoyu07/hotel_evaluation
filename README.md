Hotel Evaluation
=======

Hotel Evaluation is a PHP web application for hotels, where the user enters guests' evaluations and can monitor many statistic results, such as tables, percentages and graphs.

* **users** - multiuser environment, different rights and views over results
* **results** - stastics over specific dates, sum of dates, departments or even specific clients
* **graphics** - tables, charts, bars

2. Create a database with the name `hotel` and a user `hotel_user`
3. Import the sql file `hotel.sql` in the `hotel` database.
4. Superuser Credentials - username: `superUser` password: `1234`
